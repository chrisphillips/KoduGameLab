## Re-Center Camera

Kodu allows you to re-center the camera in edit mode when it gets "lost". Typically this happens when manipulating the camera with the mouse and you end up with the whole world in a bubble (see image).

F4 brings the camera back to a reasonable position.
Tab cycles focus through all of the characters in the world.

## Camera Usage

You can navigate your game world by controlling the camera position.
