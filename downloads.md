# Kodu Downloads

You do not need to download both files. Regular users should download and install the KoduSetup.EXE file. The KoduSetup.MSI file is for system administrators installing Kodu via SCCM. 

## Latest Version : 1.5.53.0

## Legacy Versions
If you need a specific version of Kodu, email <KoduSupport@InfiniteInstant.com>.  I have most of the older versions and will make them available as needed.
