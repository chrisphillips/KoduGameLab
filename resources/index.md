### Applied Algebra, Geometry, and Data Collection with Computer Science
![Digital Technology](dt.png) ![Computer Science](cs.png) ![Math](m.png)

Explore mathematical problems and examine relationships among data. Create and interact with objects within a three-dimensional world to study algebraic and geometric concepts.

Lesson 1: Growing Squares
Learn to describe and analyze the pattern using math sentences and relationships when given incremental changes in the area of a square.

Lesson 2: Length, Width, Area, and Perimeter
Learn to create a three-dimensional object from two-dimensional representations when given the length, width, and height measurements for quadrilaterals.

Lesson 3: Area, Perimeter, and Volume
Learn to describe the property with the appropriate standard units when given a measure of length, width, height, surface area, perimeter, and volume. 

Lesson 4: Surface Area and Volume
Learn to describe the change as a fraction of the original shape when given a change to a shape.

Lesson 5: Obstacle Course
Learn represent the situation, analyze the resulting data, and display the data in a table or graph when given a scenario.

Lesson 6: Placing and Programming Items
Learn to represent an object as a three-dimensional shape in a coordinate plane when given an object’s properties such as length, width, height, surface area, volume, and location. 

Lesson 7: Timing and Winning
Learn to plot and model the shortest paths between the locations using a computer simulation when given multiple target locations and obstacles.

Lesson 8: Double the Items
Learn to design an investigation to determine the effect on the time it takes to complete the retrieval of the items when given an increase in target items.

Lesson 9: Data
Learn to sample a population to collect performance data on the task.

Lesson 10: Showcasing Creativity
Learn to collect data, analyze it, and report your findings.
