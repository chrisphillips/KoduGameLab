### David S. Touretzky of Carnegie Mellon University Curriculum
![Digital Technology](dt.png) ![Computer Science](cs.png)

Carnegie Mellon University Kodu Curriculum helps explain the observed program behavior in terms of the code and the “laws” of computation. Also, the curriculum helps predict program behavior from the code. Finally, the curriculum helps construct programs by applying design patterns and computational principles. [See more of David's Kodu Resources for Teachers](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu).
